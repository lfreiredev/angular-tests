# NG Node WebSocket

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.7.

## Development server

Run `cd realtime-app && ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `cd backend && node src\index.js` for the backend server.

## Goals

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The goal is to show the usage of socket.io, where the app simulates several positions in a map, the backend broadcasts it and the clients (including the app that simulated the request) show those positions in the map.
